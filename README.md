# The Public's Library

This project aims to build a web application that people can use to trade books. Sometimes people want to keep a book for longer than the library allows, or they want a book that the library doesn't have available. This app allows them to find books that others are willing to trade for, in exchange for other books.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

npm run dev

Go to http://localhost:5173 to view the app

## React + TypeScript + Vite
